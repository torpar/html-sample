            <p>I have a small family.  Because I married later in life, my wife and I did not have time to have more than one child, though we would have liked to.  I think my daughter and I want more children more than my wife.  Here is a table of my immediate family:</p>
            <center><table><tr><td colspan="7">My Family Chart</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Wives</td><td>Children</td><td>Grandmas</td><td>Grandpas</td><td>Aunts</td><td>Uncles</td><td>Cousins</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr>
                </table>
