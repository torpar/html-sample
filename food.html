<p>I know, candy isn't necessarily food, but since it's edible, it counts as food. My favorite "candy food" would be sour punch, as pictured above. Sadly, it's not popular between adults, so in Halloween I got like one sour punch straw. Honestly, in Halloween I barely got any candy. <br />
My family is Middle Eastern, so we eat Middle Eastern style food. This style is basically chicken or kabob with rice. I often avoid eating it because I am a big of a fan of it like the rest of my family, but whenever I'm at parties or restaurants, I really have no choice. But I do love myself a good In-N-Out burger with fries.<p><br/>
