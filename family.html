<p>My family consists of four people: my parents, my eldest sister Sophia and my other sister (who isn't my twin, however) Ashley.<Br /> My parents are divorced, so you can say I have two families. Same siblings but different parents. That counts, right? My family is a pain in the butt, but I'm stuck with them. They all share a temper, including me, but at times they can understand my bad puns (kind of).<br />
The picture above is actually my cousin, but since she's the cutest of all my relatives (discluding me), I wanted to use her. She's 6 months, so obviously<Br /> she can't talk. Though, I have a feeling she hates everyone except her parents and my mom. :(
<br /> My eldest sister Sophia is a senior in high school and she has many big aspirations. She dreams of working in the music business and going to a college in Southern California. She gives good advice and actually has compassion, but she is sometimes irritating.
<br /> My other sister Ashley goes to Rancho as well and is also in the Tech elective. I sometimes get along with her, but there are times where I want to push her off a cliff. And no, we are not twins, we are 10 months apart.</p>
