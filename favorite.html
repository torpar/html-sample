<p>For me, it's actually very challenging to think of a favorite because I like too many things. I can never pick a favorite tv show or movie, nor a subject or food. When I told people my favorites for the class spreadsheet a while ago, I just thought of something random because if I tried to think of my favorite it would take forever.<br />
Some random favorites I have are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-family: teen">
 <li>Favorite Sport: Basketball<br/>
I don't play a lot of sports, but I can only kind of play basketball. I play badminton too, but I wouldn't say that's my all time favorite.<br /> Basketball is enjoyable and without a thought my favorite, and I did also play basketball on the team last year.</li>
<Br />
 <p><li>Favorite Season: Summer<Br />
My favorite season is summer because I have no school for a couple of months. Every other<Br /> season is just cold. It doesn't even snow here in California.</li>
 <Br />
 <li>Favorite Fruit: Pomegranate<br />
Pomegranates are probably mu favorite fruit ever. I'm now beginning to think I'm a daughter of Hades.<br /> I can't believe there are actual human beings who don't like pomegranates. <i>How?</i></li>
 <Br />
 <li>Favorite Animal: Giraffe<Br />
Since I was a child, I've always liked <i>giraffes</i>. I don't know why little-me liked them so much.<Br /> Maybe because I thought giraffes were cool because they were tall or had long tongues. </li>
 <Br />
 <li>Favorite Video Game: Animal Crossing: New Leaf<Br />
I got the game months ago, but I'm still pretty obsessed. The game is about you as a mayor in charge<Br /> of a town filled with animals. You get to create public work projects, buy clothes,<Br /> decorate your own house, kick people out of your town and bring<Br /> people in. It sounds kind of weird the way I explain it, but trust me.</li>
</ul>
