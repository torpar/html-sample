<p>Kids my age just play video games all the time or sleep or go out with their friends for fun. I usually curl up in my bed watching netflix on my computer or sit around. Nowadays, the only fun I have is doing homework. On breaks I get so bored because I usually do my homework at that time. I used to have old habits of going on my computer all the time, but now it's gone and I have no desire to use my computer during a day off.<br />Well, other than that, I do community service for fun. In the community service club Youthact, the events are actually really fun. I get to hang out with my friends, meet new people, and get hours at the same time. I already had my 3 hours from the book fair, but I did more hours from Youthact.</p>
