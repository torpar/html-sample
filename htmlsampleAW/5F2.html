<h3>"Sometimes we should express our gratitude for the small and simple things like the scent of the rain, the taste of your favorite food, or the sound of a loved one's voice."</h3> <p>--Joseph B. Wirthlin</p>
<p>I have a very strong feeling that this may be my favorite section (haha).
Here I will talk about some of my favorite things (wasn't that pretty obvious in the title?), 
of which there are not many as I am the
most indecisive creature on Earth. That may or may not have been a completely inaccurate statement.
I'm seriously really bad at picking favorites, though. Bear with me as I sort out my
internal conflicts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My Favorite Color: White</h2>
<p>Haha, you actually thought I was going to talk about my favorite color.
 Fact of the matter is, no professional ever talks about their favorite color.
 Luckily, a professional is something that I am not. 
The favorite color thing is way too cliche, but I'll provide you with one sentence about it anyway
 because there's no point in just leaving this section here to rot.</p>
<p>My favorite color is white not because it's supposed
to symbolize purity but because if I had to be stuck in a room I'd want the walls to be white
and not <font color="#6a006a">#6a006a</font>. Let's move along, shall we?</p>

<h2>My Favorite Number: 8</h2>
<p>Eight is my absolutely favorite number, in honor of one of my Favorite (lol) fictional characters:
<a href="http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Vriska_Serket">Vriska Serket</a>. Her entire character
is based around the number eight, even the way she types. But that is not why I like her! I like her
because she's a very dynamic character, and people can relate to her at many times.
You know, when I was little I used to claim that thirteen was my favorite number 
mostly because people considered it unlucky. Needless to say, I felt very proud of myself for making a number 
others didn't like my favorite. I then learned that literally every other child aiming to be 
rebellious decided that thirteen was their favorite number as well and I suddenly did not feel very
<em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>Another reason eight is my favorite number is because of this other fictional character (I'll
admit that I actually don't like him as much anymore), known as
<a href="http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Death_the_Kid">Death the Kid</a>. However, most people just call him 
that one really OCD guy who's all about things being symmetrical. 
His favorite number is also eight, in case you haven't figured that out. 
Though I'm not really into Soul Eater, when I first saw him,
I thought, '<em>This guy is super cool. Whatever he likes, I like (probably).</em>' It's really,
really dumb in retrospect, but I was young and foolish back then <s>or something</s>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my favorite number was inspired by these two super characters.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Crossover Fighting Game: Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</h2>
<p>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, or UMVC3, was released on the fifteenth of November in 2011. 
Now that I think about it, this game is pretty old. Anyways, it has an inferior version called 
Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. The difference between the two is minimal, but it's enough
to make me like UMVC3 more than its poor little brother. Capcom and Marvel tried pulling a fast one on 
us by releasing a 'better' version of MVC3, and it sadly worked. In fact, I think I can actually
reenact what their conversation probably sounded like when they were thinking of creating UMVC3:</p>

<p><strong>CAPCOM:</strong> Yeah, so, uh, we kinda need to make more money off of our players. DLC just isn't cutting it
these days.</p>
<p><strong>MARVEL:</strong> Oh, how about we, uh...I know! We'll just create an enhanced version of MVC3.</p>
<p><strong>CAPCOM:</strong> But how are we going to make the game different from the last one?</p>
<p><strong>MARVEL:</strong> Uhmmm...we'll just add a couple of new modes and characters and pass it off as original!
The players are so stupid, they'll probably notice but shove their money at us anyway.</p>
<p><strong>CAPCOM:</strong> Brilliant! Let's get working on it right away.</p>

<p>Now, if I was a random person reading this, I would probably be thinking, '<em>Does she hate this game or
something? She's only listing out its flaws and how the two collaborating companies tried to rip her off!</em>'
While all of that is <em>true</em>, you can tell that the creators worked hard on the game (even if they are cheap as all heck).
The art, animation, music, and all of the other goodies that come with it make it worth playing <s>for at least two hours</s>. There's online battling, 
a training mode, a two player mode, endings for all of the players in arcade mode, a gallery, and so much more.</p>

<p>I suppose that I need to show something for all of my talk. Below, you shall find some pictures and music that relate to this
wondrous game. <s>I made sure to include all of my favorite characters.</s></p>

<p>This is Vergil, a character from the series Devil May Cry. Here we see his <s>COOL</s> victory pose.</p>

<p>I did not fail to add some of the characters' themes, either. From left to right: Vergil, Trish, Spiderman, Iron Man.</p>
</div>
<p>Just so you know, it was somewhat of a challenge getting these friggin' themes on here. While trying to get Youtube's iframes to work, I kept getting an error message.
Eventually, I found that <font face="courier new">src="//www.youtube..."</font> had to be changed to
<font face="courier new">src="http://www.youtube..."</font> It took a minimal amount of time to find the error,
but it was still pretty annoying.

<p>Time for my exciting conclusion: I do hope that they'll eventually come out with a Marvel vs. Capcom 4. I do not hope that they come out with a 'better' version of it
to get more money out of us. I'd like to have some faith in my favorite companies, but it's just not possible with today's gaming society.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby: Drawing</h2>
<p>I'm beginning to wonder if drawing is actually my favorite hobby, seeing as how whenever I attempt to draw,
I end up becoming angry because I <em>can't</em>.</p>
<p>I think I started drawing when I was about three, and I will not bring up any of the art I made at that age. I'm sure 
that if you were in my position, you'd feel the same way.</p>
<p>...I really don't know what else to say about drawing. It's frustrating, it's difficult, it's impossible to get anything artistic
out of my hands.</p>
<p>I use a digital art tablet, in case you never knew. I used to be more interested in traditional art, but after seeing the amazing
things that could be created with digital, I decided two years ago (though I got my tablet one year ago) that I wanted to dive into
the world of digital art. I received my Wacom Intuos Something Something last Christmas. <em>Cue a heart icon. &lt;3</em> 
That's right: 
a <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/us/creative/intuos-s">Wacom Intuos Something Something</a>.</p>

<p>I don't really draw traditionally anymore, but my digital art is plentiful <s>though I have scrapped most of my works</s>:</p>

<p>This here is a drawing (that took several painful hours) of one of my OCs (Original Characters), Ixchel Afolayan.</p>

<p>This is another sketch of Dertah <s>that I find incredibly embarrassing.</s> I was unable to resize this image, as doing so would mess up the quality of the picture. :(</p>

<img src="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/221/e/9/dolphi_by_kanra_nakurome-d7udb06.png">

<p>This is <em>not</em> one of my original characters. One day, I decided that I wanted to make some nice fanart of a 
character from one of my favorite games: <a href="http://okegom.web.fc2.com/story/wadanohara/">Wadanohara and the Great Blue Sea</a>. 
Thus, I decided I wanted to draw scaredy-cat <a href="http://okegom.web.fc2.com/character/0155.html">Dolphi</a>,
 who you can find on the creator's site. <s>The creator has much nicer art than I do.</s></p>
</div>
<p>Time for another one of my thrilling conclusions: <em>I DON'T LIKE MY ART NOW GET YER BUTT OVER TO THE NEXT SECTION.</em></p>

<h2>My Favorite Shark: Whale Shark</h2>
<p>I wanted to describe to you eight of my favorite things, but UMVC3 took up way too much room and I don't have that many favorites anyway.
 For these reasons, I will end this lovely Favorites page with my favoritest (this is an actual word) creature in the whole, wide Earth: 
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark">whale shark</a>!</p>
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Whale_shark_Georgia_aquarium.jpg" style="width:700px;height:500px;"/>
<p>Take a few moments to observe this majestic creature.</p>
<p>I used to think they were orange for some odd, unexplainable reason. Further research on my part has revealed that they are more 
<font color="#252D3A">#252D3A</font> than orange, and their bellies are a pure <font color="#ffffff">#FFFFFF</font>. You can blame
Go, Diego, Go! for making me think they were orange. I think that show first introduced me to whale sharks...?</p>
<p>Whale sharks are very docile and live deep where humans cannot kill them off for the heck of it. If I had a pet whale shark,
 I would in all likelihood kill it by accident. Taking care of something that huge and awesome just wouldn't work. Fish and plankton do not think 
of whale sharks as their BFFs either because they are just plain jealous they will never be able to be as cool or because whale sharks 
can inhale them as quickly as a kindergartner can inhale Pixy Stix on Halloween.</p>
<p>Whale sharks are so docile, in fact, that divers sometimes just hitch a ride on their backs and chill there for a while. I suspect that 
the reason the whale shark doesn't mind is because it has come to terms with the realization that they are the most amazing creatures on Earth, 
and therefore can't get angry when random meaty stick figures decide that they want to hang around on their backs for a couple of minutes.
 If you take the time to search my theory up, you will find that what I am saying is absolutely true and everything you are reading right now is changing your life.</p>

<p>As thanks for managing to get yourself through this entire page, I offer you an 'Unsure whale shark', courtesy of <a href="http://fettergeist.deviantart.com/">Fettergeist</a>:</p>
