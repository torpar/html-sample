<h3>"My family is my strength and weakness."</h3> <p>--Aishwarya Rai Bachchan</p>
<p>My family is made up of incredibly strange individuals, who were made by even stranger
 individuals (though I don't know them). This would explain why I am what the other 
adolescents call a <em>weirdo</em>. Below I will reveal facts that no other human being has
 any knowledge of, with the exception of my family members (seeing as how these facts are about them).</p>
<hr>
<h3>My Mother:</h3>
<img src="https://s-i.huffpost.com/gen/1127375/images/o-DUBSTEP-MOM-MAMA-SONG-facebook.jpg">
<p>This is Mommeh, or Mommy, or Mom, or Motha. She's my mom, in case you haven't picked that one up. 
She's Max's mom too, but she didn't give birth to him, so. If she did and she hasn't told me yet, I think we have some issues to sort out. 
Mommeh/Mommy/Mom/Motha enjoys sunbathing in rainbows made from unicorn tears and she works at an office where they sell the breath of God in jars. I 
had to edit out her halo and wings because I couldn't risk having her image placed all over the Internet.</p>

<p>Mom's actually a mortgage loan officer who in fact does not sell the breath of God in jars but in tubes. She has the attitude of a phone that has 76% battery
 and is prepared to kick bullies' butts. To put it simply, she's like Captain Underpants with clothes on. Whenever she speaks to Max, she kind of sounds like
 she inhaled helium for breakfast. Max does not seem to appreciate the gesture, despite being given many treats as a bribe. I wouldn't feel the same way if 
I had to eat the same thing everyday for the rest of my life and got treats, like, every day.</p>

<p>Pros: Best hugger ever</p>
<p>Cons: Has a grip strength of 0+ with Max</p>

<h3>My Grandmother:</h3>
<img src="http://ak4.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/19553224/thumb/8.jpg" style="width:300px;height:500px;"/>
<p>Above we observe an uncannily stupendous specimen in its natural habitat. Take your time to 
bask in its grace, in its captivating charm. No, don't. That's creepy.</p>

<p>This is my grandmother, Jean. Unfortunately, thanks to a certain anime, I always read her name as 'John.' It's such a pain. 
I don't have to deal with this <em>Jean-John</em> stuff, though, because I call her 'Ama.' It's short and easy to pronounce for a lazy person such as I, you see. 
Ama is <s>obviously</s> married to the frail, frail old man below but we all know she loves me the most. I neglect to mention this to my other family members for fear 
they will feel unloved.</p>
<p>Pros: Daughter of God</p>
<p>Cons: Stressed out easily</p>
<h3>My Step-Grandfather:</h3>
<img src="https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8777/17304302006_019e5a22ed_b.jpg" style="width:300px;height:500px;"/>

<p>This is a very fitting photo, despite his arms being blurred. Let's just call that 'special effects.' See how his expression conveys a sort of strict air, 
and his <s>blurred</s> crossed arms show the dignified pose of a person who will stand his ground no matter what.</p>
<p>Nah, I'm kidding. This guy is the most carefree person in the world. He's kind of like a jellyfish that doesn't feel the need to sting you 88,888,888 times for no 
reason.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you a story about <em>Uncle Hunter</em>, aka my step-grandfather. It is a relatively short one, so do not fret.
 The reason I say 'uncle' instead of 'grandfather' or something is simply because when the world was created (meaning I), he didn't want to seem old.
 The term 'grandpa' just seemed too elderly for him, so we sticked with 'uncle.' That's what the authorities tell me, anyway. They may be planning some kind 
of conspiracy that somehow has to do with me calling my step-grandfather 'uncle,' but who knows.</p>
<p>Pros: <em>THE NICEST PERSON EVER</em></p>
<p>Cons: Stubborn, likes dancing obnoxiously when he wins at UMVC3 (which happens once in a blue moon)</p>

<h3>My <s>(GODFORSAKEN)</s> Cat:</h3>
<img src="https://www.iizcat.com/uploads/2016/06/b1uyk-sen1.jpg" style="width:500px;height:300px;"/>
<p>I would've liked to include the other members of my family, but there simply isn't enough room. (just look at what happened
 to the <a href="5F2.html">previous</a> page) Thus, I decided I wanted to conclude with a little description of my cat, Max.</p>
<p>First of all, let's officially establish the fact that I absolutely despise him. Nothing anyone ever shows or tells me 
will change that fact. I'd rather include him than a certain dog <s>I hate</s> though, so here goes nothing:</p>

<p>Max the cat was first found sometime in May 2010, when my mom and I were driving home from my great grandmother's house. 
We quite literally ran into him and his sibling(?), without all of the bloodshed and horrified screams. My mom parked the car 
in the middle of the street and we found two itty bitty <em>cuuuute</em> kitties. Max's sibling(?) ran away, but Max himself actually 
stayed still and let my mom pick him up.</p>
<p>Blahbity blah blah, mom and I drop by a store to pick up some food. An employee notices instantly that mom's hiding a kitten under 
her clothes. To be honest, if she <em>didn't</em> notice, there would've been a problem. Despite such hindrances, we press on...with 
me staying in the car with him. I think I put him in a hat or something while we were waiting. As I write this, I squee from thinking
 about how gosh-darn cute he was back then.</p>
<p>This is actually getting pretty mundane. Alright, let's skip past this boring scene and...talk about how I shed fake tears in order to 
keep him, which was possibly the worst decision I've ever made. I've lived over thirteen years, and shedding fake tears to keep this godforsaken cat
 was the worst one ever. Just let the impact of that statement sink in. Mom used to hate cats, and I mean hate with a capital H. 
She was looking a little hesitant about throwing him back out that fateful night, though, so I decided to utilize my 'fake tears' skill in order 
to keep Max. Once again, the worst decision made in the history of Angeliquekind.</p>
<p>Well, Max turned out to be a complete <a href="http://willvideoforfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/poop.png">____</a> He bit, he scratched, he did everything that I did not really want of a cat.
 He was so awful, in fact, that ASPCA would probably not want to include him in one of their commercials about animal abuse.
 Thankfully, he's less of a <a href="http://willvideoforfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/poop.png">____</a> now. He's still temperamental as all heck and I still don't like him, but he gives me less homicidal feelings. 
The very fact that I am talking about his existence right now is proof that I have been receiving less homicidal thoughts whenever he comes into my field of vision.</p>

<p>Pros: Fluffy</p>
<p>Cons: Everything</p>
