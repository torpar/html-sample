<h3>The story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye, the story of love is hello and goodbye."</h3> <p>--Jimi Hendrix</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
<p>My name is Angelique Wei, and it may do you some good to know that 
the only reason I am handing you such precious information is because the only person
I can imagine reading this is my teacher, Thor Parker. I mean, I really doubt that
my classmates will be willing to pay my traditional $8 viewing fee (teachers get to look at this for
free!).</p>
<p>Here on this lovely Front page I will describe everything that you will be exploring,
which should take about one sentence. Observe:</p>
<p>Throughout this website you will go through some of my <a href="5F2.html">Favorite</a> things 
(<a href="5F4.html">Food</a> included), take a look at 
my <a href="5F3.html">Family</a>, and have <a href="5F5.html">FUN</a>! See, I told you it wouldn't
take much more than one sentence.
Also, the navigation at the top will direct you to any page you please.</p>
<p>Buckle up and enjoy.</p>
<p>--Angelique Wei, (reluctant) Student</p>
