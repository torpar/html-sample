<h3>"My philosophy is: If you can't have fun, there's no sense in doing it."</h3> <p>--Paul Walker</p>
<p>And now...I can finally present...the <em>final page</em>. The Favorites page has a new rival. For the 
sake of keeping this page <em>fun</em>, I have added a helpful script source in my &lt;head&gt; tag, which contains... <em>(wait for the dramatic pause)</em></p>
<div id='jquery'>
<h3>Jquery! (click on me)</h3>
</div>
<div id="jquery2">
<p>That was cool, huh. If you click on the above heading again, this paragraph will disappear.</p>
</div>
<p>Jquery is coding magic that brings <em>fun</em> without you actually having to apply much Javascript knowledge (thankfully), which is why I am planning to marry it when I grow up and become a princess.</p>
<div id='jquery3'>
<h3>But! (click on me)</h3>
</div>
<div id='jquery4'>
<p>I am also going to show you some other magical things that you will almost certainly enjoy. 'Why does the author think I will enjoy them?', one may ask. Well, not only will I be showing you these magical things...but I will also integrate Jquery awesomeness (is that a word?) whilst presenting them to you! Just watch!</p>

<h2>Games:</h2>
</div>
<p>You know the drill by now. Click 'Games.'</p>
<div class='games2'>
<p>Have you ever wanted to play some online games but you just can't because...well, actually, I don't know. But have you ever just wanted to play a game and for some odd, unexplainable reason you <em>can't</em>? WELL HERE ARE SOME AWESOME SITES AND GAMES, BRO:</p>

<h4><a href='http://www.miniclip.com/games/en/'>Miniclip</a>, a site with a large variety of mini games.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.nitrome.com/'>Nitrome</a> has tons of cute pixel-style mini games.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.kongregate.com/games/gregoryweir/the-majesty-of-colors'>The Majesty of Colors</a>, a short but interesting game about a sea monster and the world around it.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://bartbonte.com/portal/tinydangerousdungeons.html'>Tiny Dangerous Dungeons</a>, an awesome 8-bit dungeon platformer with rad music.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.deadwhale.com/play.php?game=1631'>Haunt the House</a>, a Halloweenesque game about a ghost trying to get its home back from partying people.</h4>

<p>Enough of the online games for now. Next, I'll present some <em>virus-free</em> PC games (Mac works for some of them too, though) that are off the charts in awesomeness: (Is 'awesomeness' a word?)</p>

<h4><a href='http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dl/win95/game/se463417.html'>Irisu Syndrome</a>, a somewhat creepy puzzle game. <a href='http://www.mediafire.com/download/nlujzb91wjl0bu7/IrisuSyndromeENv2.03.zip'>Here</a> is the English patch. (Move the contents of the English patch into the 'data' folder.)</h4>
<h4><a href='http://vgperson.com/games/ib.htm'>Ib</a>, a horror game where a girl visits what first seems to be an ornate art gallery.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://vgperson.com/games/misao.htm'>Misao</a>, another horror game in which you must find a girl's...body parts. Great story, but extremely violent and not for the sensitive souls.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://vgperson.com/games/wadanohara.htm'>Wadanohara and the Great Blue Sea</a>, a beautifully made 'pseudo-RPG' about a young witch who goes back to her sea after finding out that troubles have recently been plaguing it.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://vgperson.com/games/alicemare.htm'>Alice Mare</a>, a horroresque adventure game with a fairy tale theme.</h4>
<h4>LiEat ( <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/lieat.htm">1</a>,<a href="http://vgperson.com/games/lieat2.htm">2</a>,<a href='http://vgperson.com/games/lieat3.htm'>3</a> ), a short and cute RPG about a lie-eating dragon named Efina and her 'papa,' Teobaldo Leonhearts.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://yumenikki.wikia.com/wiki/Yume_Nikki'>Yume Nikki</a>, a horror RPG that involves exploring a girl named Madotsuki's dreams and collecting 'effects,' little eggs that give you different powers.</h4>

<div class='websites'>
<h2>Websites:</h2>
</div>
<p>Now click 'Websites.'</p>
<div class='websites2'>
<p>I shall now present you with some great websites that--while they don't involve games--are worth checking out because they're just amazing and that's all there really is to say on the matter.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/dailydeviations/">deviantArt</a>, a site with both inspiring and kind of stupid art. Mostly inspiring, but there are always those pictures that make me think, '<em>???</em>'</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.pixiv.net/'>Pixiv</a>, another site with lots and lots of beautiful art.</h4>
<h4><a href='https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard'>Tumblr</a>, a social media platform that has way too many 'keyboard warriors' but is pretty cool in other regards.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.crunchyroll.com/'>Crunchyroll</a>, an anime hosting site. It has lots of ads, which is pretty darn annoying. (Using Adblock seems to solve the problem, though.)</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.amazon.com/'>Amazon</a>. Just...<em>Amazon</em>.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.pandora.com/'>Pandora</a>, a music hosting site that charges you music for the low, low price of free and some ads unless you use Adblock.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://okegom.web.fc2.com/'>Mogeko</a>, one of my favorite artists ever. Including their site was just very necessary.</h4>
<h4><a href='http://www.codecademy.com/'>Codecademy</a> and <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/'>W3schools</a>, a great pair of sites where you can learn about programming for the low, low price of free. That's my kind of price.</h4>

<p>This one ended up being a lot longer than I expected.</p>
<p>...That is a good thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, it appears that this journey has met its pleasant end. I actually had more fun than I thought I would (at times) while making this. Fin.</p>
