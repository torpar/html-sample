            <p>I love to eat.  I have eaten so many scrumtious things in my life.  I have also eaten some un-scrumptious foods like ants, crickets, and a lizard tail!  I am defintely an omnivore.  Of all the things I've tried, the one that I love the most, the one I can't say no too, the one that makes me eat too much, is cookies.  I just love them.  Here are my favorites in order of preference:</p><ol><li>chocolate chip <li>snickerdoodle<li>peanut butter<li>Oreo</ol><p>Even though those are the best, I will eat most any kind of cookie.  They are the scrumpdillyicious!</p>
