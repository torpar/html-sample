        <section><center><h1>For Fun</h1></center><p>I like to play soccer for fun.  I've played since I was eleven years old.  I was never fast or a good ball handler.  But, I tried hard.  During college, I took a break from playing, then started again in my thirties, playing on an adult team for the next twenty years. I had to have shoulder surgery after playing goalie and broke some ribs running into another player.  But, I still had fun. </p>
