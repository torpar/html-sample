        <section><center><h1>My Favorite Football Team</h1></center><p>I have been a fan of the <a href="http://www.vikings.com/">  Minnesota Vikings</a> ever since I was little kid in the Seventies.  At that time, they were a Super Bowl contender and went a couple of times, only to lose.  I just knew they would get back into the Super Bowl and I liked their Viking mascot, so I picked them. Unfortunately, they did go back to the Super Bowl, only to lose again.  For a long time, they were the team with the most Super Bowl losses, a record that has been surpassed by the Buffalo Bills.  I am a loyal kind of guy and have stuck with the Vikes through a lot of awful seasons.  They are finally becoming an upper tier team again and may be back in the Super Bowl soon.  I hope they win this time!</p>
